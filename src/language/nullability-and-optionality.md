# Nullability and Optionality

In C#, `null` is often used to represent a value that is missing, absent or
logically uninitialized. For example:

```csharp
int? some = 1;
int? none = null;
```

Rust has no `null` and consequently no nullable context to enable. Optional or
missing values are instead represented by [`Option<T>`][option]. The
equivalent of the C# code above in Rust would be:

```rust
let some: Option<i32> = Some(1);
let none: Option<i32> = None;
```

`Option<T>` in Rust is practically identical to [`'T option`][opt.fs] from F#.

## Control flow with optionality

In C#, you may have been using `if`/`else` statements for controlling the flow
when using nullable values.

```csharp
uint? max = 10;
if (max is { } someMax)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"The maximum is {someMax}."); // The maximum is 10.
}
```

You can use pattern matching to achieve the same behavior in Rust:

It would even be more concise to use `if let`:

```rust
let max = Some(10u32);
if let Some(max) = max {
    println!("The maximum is {}.", max); // The maximum is 10.
}
```

## Null-conditional operators

The null-conditional operators (`?.` and `?[]`) make dealing with `null` in C#
more ergonomic. In Rust, they are best replaced by using the [`map`][optmap]
method. The following snippets show the correspondence:

```csharp
string? some = "Hello, World!";
string? none = null;
Console.WriteLine(some?.Length); // 13
Console.WriteLine(none?.Length); // (blank)
```

```rust
let some: Option<String> = Some(String::from("Hello, World!"));
let none: Option<String> = None;
println!("{:?}", some.map(|s| s.len())); // Some(13)
println!("{:?}", none.map(|s| s.len())); // None
```

## Null-coalescing operator

The null-coalescing operator (`??`) is typically used to default to another
value when a nullable is `null`:

```csharp
int? some = 1;
int? none = null;
Console.WriteLine(some ?? 0); // 1
Console.WriteLine(none ?? 0); // 0
```

In Rust, you can use [`unwrap_or`][unwrap-or] to get the same behavior:

```rust
let some: Option<i32> = Some(1);
let none: Option<i32> = None;
println!("{:?}", some.unwrap_or(0)); // 1
println!("{:?}", none.unwrap_or(0)); // 0
```

**Note**: If the default value is expensive to compute, you can use
`unwrap_or_else` instead. It takes a closure as an argument, which allows you to
lazily initialize the default value.

## Null-forgiving operator

The null-forgiving operator (`!`) does not correspond to an equivalent construct
in Rust, as it only affects the compiler's static flow analysis in C#. In Rust,
there is no need to use a substitute for it.
