# Scalar Types

The following table lists the primitive types in Rust and their equivalent in
C# and .NET:

| Rust    | C#        | .NET                   | Note             |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| `bool`  | `bool`    | `Boolean`              |                  |
| `char`  | `char`    | `Char`                 | See note 1.      |
| `i8`    | `sbyte`   | `SByte`                |                  |
| `i16`   | `short`   | `Int16`                |                  |
| `i32`   | `int`     | `Int32`                |                  |
| `i64`   | `long`    | `Int32`                |                  |
| `i128`  |           | `Int128`               |                  |
| `isize` | `nint`    | `IntPtr`               |                  |
| `u8`    | `byte`    | `Byte`                 |                  |
| `u16`   | `ushort`  | `UInt16`               |                  |
| `u32`   | `uint`    | `UInt32`               |                  |
| `u64`   | `ulong`   | `UInt64`               |                  |
| `u128`  |           | `UInt128`              |                  |
| `usize` | `nuint`   | `UIntPtr`              |                  |
| `f32`   | `float`   | `Single`               |                  |
| `f64`   | `double`  | `Double`               |                  |
|         | `decimal` | `Decimal`              |                  |
| `()`    | `void`    | `Void` or `ValueTuple` | See notes 2 & 3. |
|         | `object`  | `Object`               | See note 3.      |

Notes:

1. [`char`][char.rs] in Rust and [`Char`][char.net] in .NET have different
   definitions. In Rust, `char` is 4 bytes wide that is a [Unicode scalar
   value], but in .NET, a `Char` is 2 bytes wides uses the UTF-16 encoding.
   For more information, see the [Rust `char` documentation][char.rs].

2. While a unit `()` (an empty tuple) in Rust is a _expressible value_, the
   closest cousin in C# would be `void` to represent nothing. However, `void`
   isn't an _expressible value_ except when using pointers and unsafe code. .NET
   has [`ValueTuple`][ValueTuple] that is an empty tuple, but C# does not have
   a literal syntax like `()` to represent. `ValueTuple` can be used in C#,
   but it's very uncommon. Unlike C#, [F# does have a unit type][unit.fs] like
   Rust.

3. While `void` and `object` are not scalar types (although scalars like `int`
   are sub-classes of `object` in the .NET type hierarchy), they've been
   included in the above table for convenience.
