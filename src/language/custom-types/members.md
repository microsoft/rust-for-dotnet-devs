## Constructors

Rust does not have any notion of constructors. Instead, you just write factory
functions that return an instance of the type. The factory functions can be
stand-alone or _associated functions_ of the type. In C# terms, associated
functions are like have static methods on a type. Conventionally, if there is
just one factory function for a `struct`, it's named `new`:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    x1: i32, y1: i32,
    x2: i32, y2: i32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    pub fn new(x1: i32, y1: i32, x2: i32, y2: i32) -> Self {
        Self { x1, y1, x2, y2 }
    }
}
```

Since Rust functions (associated or otherwise) do not support overloading, the
factory functions have to be named uniquely. For example, below are some
examples of so-called constructors or factory functions available on `String`:

- `String::new`: creates an empty string.
- `String::with_capacity`: creates a string with an initial buffer capacity.
- `String::from_utf8`: creates a string from bytes of UTF-8 encoded text.
- `String::from_utf16`: creates a string from bytes of UTF-16 encoded text.

In the case of an `enum` type in Rust, the variants act as the constructors.
See [the section on enumeration types][enums] for more.

## Methods (static & instance-based)

Like C#, Rust types (both `enum` and `struct`), can have static and
instance-based methods. In Rust-speak, a _method_ is always instance-based and
is identified by the fact that its first parameter is named `self`. The `self`
parameter has no type annotation since it's always the type to which the
method belongs. A static method is called an _associated function_. In the
example below, `new` is an associated function and the rest (`length`, `width`
and `area`) are methods of the type:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    x1: i32, y1: i32,
    x2: i32, y2: i32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    pub fn new(x1: i32, y1: i32, x2: i32, y2: i32) -> Self {
        Self { x1, y1, x2, y2 }
    }

    pub fn length(&self) -> i32 {
        self.y2 - self.y1
    }

    pub fn width(&self)  -> i32 {
        self.x2 - self.x1
    }

    pub fn area(&self)  -> i32 {
        self.length() * self.width()
    }
}
```

## Constants

Like in C#, a type in Rust can have constants. However, the most interesting
aspect to note is that Rust allows a type instance to be defined as a constant
too:

```rust
struct Point {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

impl Point {
    const ZERO: Point = Point { x: 0, y: 0 };
}
```

In C#, the same would require a static read-only field:

```c#
readonly record struct Point(int X, int Y)
{
    public static readonly Point Zero = new(0, 0);
}
```

## Events

Rust has no built-in support for type members to adverstise and fire events,
like C# has with the `event` keyword.

## Properties

In C#, fields of a type are generally private. They are then
protected/encapsulated by property members with accessor methods (`get`, and
`set`) to read or write to those field. The accessor methods can contain extra
logic, for example, to either validate the value when being set or compute a
value when being read. Rust only has methods [where a getter is named after the
field (in Rust method names can share the same identifier as a field) and the
setter uses a `set_` prefix][get-set-name.rs].

  [get-set-name.rs]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0344-conventions-galore.md#gettersetter-apis

Below is an example showing how property-like accessor methods typically look
for a type in Rust:

```rust
struct Rectangle {
    x1: i32, y1: i32,
    x2: i32, y2: i32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    pub fn new(x1: i32, y1: i32, x2: i32, y2: i32) -> Self {
        Self { x1, y1, x2, y2 }
    }

    // like property getters (each shares the same name as the field)

    pub fn x1(&self) -> i32 { self.x1 }
    pub fn y1(&self) -> i32 { self.y1 }
    pub fn x2(&self) -> i32 { self.x2 }
    pub fn y2(&self) -> i32 { self.y2 }

    // like property setters

    pub fn set_x1(&mut self, val: i32) { self.x1 = val }
    pub fn set_y1(&mut self, val: i32) { self.y1 = val }
    pub fn set_x2(&mut self, val: i32) { self.x2 = val }
    pub fn set_y2(&mut self, val: i32) { self.y2 = val }

    // like computed properties

    pub fn length(&self) -> i32 {
        self.y2 - self.y1
    }

    pub fn width(&self)  -> i32 {
        self.x2 - self.x1
    }

    pub fn area(&self)  -> i32 {
        self.length() * self.width()
    }
}
```

## Extension Methods

Extension methods in C# enable the developer to attach new statically-bound
methods to existing types, without needing to modify the original definition
of the type. In the following C# example, a new `Wrap` method is added to the
`StringBuilder` class _by extension_:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Text;
using Extensions; // (1)

var sb = new StringBuilder("Hello, World!");
sb.Wrap(">>> ", " <<<"); // (2)
Console.WriteLine(sb.ToString()); // Prints: >>> Hello, World! <<<

namespace Extensions
{
    static class StringBuilderExtensions
    {
        public static void Wrap(this StringBuilder sb,
                                string left, string right) =>
            sb.Insert(0, left).Append(right);
    }
}
```

Note that for an extension method to become available (2), the namespace with
the type containing the extension method must be imported (1). Rust offers a
very similar facility via traits, called _extension traits_. The following
example in Rust is the equivalent of the C# example above; it extends `String`
with the method `wrap`:

```rust
#![allow(dead_code)]

mod exts {
    pub trait StrWrapExt {
        fn wrap(&mut self, left: &str, right: &str);
    }

    impl StrWrapExt for String {
        fn wrap(&mut self, left: &str, right: &str) {
            self.insert_str(0, left);
            self.push_str(right);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    use exts::StrWrapExt as _; // (1)

    let mut s = String::from("Hello, World!");
    s.wrap(">>> ", " <<<"); // (2)
    println!("{s}"); // Prints: >>> Hello, World! <<<
}
```

Just like in C#, for the method in the extension trait to become available
(2), the extension trait must be imported (1). Also note, the extension trait
identifier `StrWrapExt` can itself be discarded via `_` at the time of import
without affecting the availability of `wrap` for `String`.

## Visibility/Access modifiers

C# has a number of accessibility or visibility modifiers:

- `private`
- `protected`
- `internal`
- `protected internal` (family)
- `public`

In Rust, a compilation is built-up of a tree of modules where modules contain
and define [_items_][items] like types, traits, enums, constants and
functions. Almost everything is private by default. One exception is, for
example, _associated items_ in a public trait, which are public by default.
This is similar to how members of a C# interface declared without any public
modifiers in the source code are public by default. Rust only has the `pub`
modifier to change the visibility with respect to the module tree. There
are variations of `pub` that change the scope of the public visibility:

- `pub(self)`
- `pub(super)`
- `pub(crate)`
- `pub(in PATH)`

For more details, see the [Visibility and Privacy][privis] section of The Rust
Reference.

  [privis]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/visibility-and-privacy.html
  [items]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items.html

The table below is an approximation of the mapping of C# and Rust modifiers:

| C#                            | Rust         | Note        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `private`                     | (default)    | See note 1. |
| `protected`                   | N/A          | See note 2. |
| `internal`                    | `pub(crate)` |             |
| `protected internal` (family) | N/A          | See note 2. |
| `public`                      | `pub`        |             |

1. There is no keyword to denote private visibility; it's the default in Rust.

2. Since there are no class-based type hierarchies in Rust, there is no
   equivalent of `protected`.

## Mutability

When designing a type in C#, it is the responsiblity of the developer to
decide whether the a type is mutable or immutable; whether it supports
destructive or non-destructive mutations. C# does support an immutable design
for types with a _positional record declaration_ (`record class` or `readonly
record struct`). In Rust, mutability is expressed on methods through the type
of the `self` parameter as shown in the example below:

```rust
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }

impl Point {
    pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }

    // self is not mutable

    pub fn x(&self) -> i32 { self.x }
    pub fn y(&self) -> i32 { self.y }

    // self is mutable

    pub fn set_x(&mut self, val: i32) { self.x = val }
    pub fn set_y(&mut self, val: i32) { self.y = val }
}
```

In C#, you can do non-destructive mutations using `with`:

```c#
var pt = new Point(123, 456);
pt = pt with { X = 789 };
Console.WriteLine(pt.ToString()); // prints: Point { X = 789, Y = 456 }

readonly record struct Point(int X, int Y);
```

There is no `with` in Rust, but to emulate something similar in Rust, it has
to be baked into the type's design:

```rust
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }

impl Point {
    pub fn new(x: i32, y: i32) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }

    pub fn x(&self) -> i32 { self.x }
    pub fn y(&self) -> i32 { self.y }

    // following methods consume self and return a new instance

    pub fn set_x(self, val: i32) -> Self { Self::new(val, self.y) }
    pub fn set_y(self, val: i32) -> Self { Self::new(self.x, val) }
}
```

It is also possible to use the struct update syntax to achieve something similar. This moves the original value:

```rust
mod points {
    #[derive(Debug)]
    pub struct Point { pub x: i32, pub y: i32 }
}

fn main() {
    use points::Point;
    let pt = Point { x: 123, y: 456 };
    let pt = Point { x: 789, ..pt };
    println!("{pt:?}"); // prints: Point { x: 789, y: 456 }
}```

As seen in the example above, the struct update syntax requires access to the type fields.
Therefore, it is generally more common to use it within the module that has access to private details of its types.
