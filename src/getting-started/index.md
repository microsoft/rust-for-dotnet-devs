# Getting Started

Sections of this document contain several Rust examples you can just run in the
online [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/).

In case a full-fledged solution is needed, you can try out to setup an online
available [sample project](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-rust)
either directly in GitHub Codespaces or as a Visual Studio Code Dev Container.

This alternative is suggested to give you additional flexibility, in the case
you would like to experiment with additional [cargo dependencies](#dependencies)
like the ones needed in [code coverage](#code-coverage).
