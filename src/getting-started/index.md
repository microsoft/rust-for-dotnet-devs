# Getting Started

## Rust Playground

The easiest way to get started with Rust without needing any local
installation is to use the [Rust Playground]. It is a minimal development
front-end that runs in the Web browser and allows writing and running Rust
code.

## Dev Container

The execution environment of the [Rust Playground] has some limitations, such
as total compilation/execution time, memory and networking so another
option that does not require installing Rust would be to use a _dev
container_, such as the one provided in the repository
<https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-rust>. Like Rust Playground,
the dev container can be run directly in a Web browser using [GitHub
Codespaces] or [locally using Visual Studio Code][vscode-dev-containers].

## Local Install

For a complete local installation of Rust compiler and its development tools,
see the [Installation] section of the [Getting Started] chapter in the [The
Rust Programming Language][rs-book] book, or [the Install page] at
[rust-lang.org].
